# Prompt CLI

A command-line tool for creating prompts with file references.

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/louislva/prompt.git
```

Or install for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louislva/prompt.git
cd prompt
pip install -e .
```

To uninstall:

```bash
pip uninstall prompt-cli
```

## Usage

Simply run `prompt` in your terminal. Type `@` to get file suggestions.

```bash
prompt
```

This will open a prompt session. Typing `@` followed by part of a filename will autocomplete file paths based on recent modification.

## Settings

Prompt CLI supports customizable settings. The available settings include:

- `style_prompt`: A custom string appended to every generated prompt.

### Modifying Settings

Enter settings modification mode:

```bash
prompt --settings
```

This will prompt you to edit the `style_prompt` directly from your terminal. This prompt will be automatically appended to all prompts generated by `prompt`.

### Resetting Settings

To reset settings to defaults:

```bash
prompt --reset-settings
```

This resets `user_settings.json` to its default state.
